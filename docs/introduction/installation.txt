Quick install guide
===================

The easiest way to install Adjax is to use use ``pip``, if you have it:

    pip install adjax

If you don't, and you prefer the old school ``easy_install``, then the following command is for you:

    easy_install adjax

Not So Quick install
--------------------

If you don't have ``easy_install`` or ``pip`` installed, you will need to do things manually. 
Firstly, install Django by following the installation instructions at http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/.  

Next download the Adjax release from http://code.google.com/p/django-adjax/. To unpack and install it, run the following from your shell::

    tar xvzf adjax-1.1.tar.gz
    cd adjax-1.1.0/
    python setup.py install

That's it, you've installed everything you need to install. You can now try the :ref:`tutorial <introduction-tutorial>`.
