Welcome to Adjax

Design
------

There are three components to Adjax:

- Functions for preparing an Ajax response
- Template tags for preparing Ajax-optimised HTML
- A Javascript library for handling responses from our system

Other Ajax Frameworks
---------------------

Many other people are of course doing similar things with Django and Ajax. 
Adjax does basic Ajax tasks well and cleanly, but other libraries offer features that may be more useful for you:

- File upload progress
- Dynamic choices and predictive combo boxes

.. A few frameworks have sprouted from their efforts: Dajax, django-ajax-validation, django-ajax-forms
   See also upload progress: http://fairviewcomputing.com/blog/2008/10/21/ajax-upload-progress-bars-jquery-django-nginx/
