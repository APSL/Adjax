Adjax is a Django based framework, which facilitates and organises Ajax-based websites. The aim is to keep code a clear interface for Ajax functionatliy, keeping your code clean and easy to follow.

Design
------

There are three components to Adjax:

- Functions for preparing an Ajax response
- Template tags for preparing Ajax-optimised HTML
- A Javascript library for handling responses from our system

All three components are optional, the Javascript library is currently available for jQuery, but you are free to provide your own alternative. See the details in the :ref:`Developer's Guide <reference-developers>`
